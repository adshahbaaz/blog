<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Often times simple problems demand harder thought for an elegant solution.</p>
<p>Here we would like to write an algorithm that returns all the factors for a particular n. </p>
<p>To optimise our algorithm, let us consider the limits of the factors of a number. Once we reach the square root of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> all succesive numbers that are factors of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> will have some multiple that belongs to the set of numbers below <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Thus, The greatest factor of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> has to be <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> divided by one of the values retrieved from the first array. .</p>
<p>We break our solution down into two parts. First, we limit our search for factors below <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt n\)</span> and select factors of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> from this array.Then we search for factors above this threshold, knowing that there exists part of a pair in the array above that successfully multiplies by a number(s) in the current list to yield <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. The combined result of these two operations will yield all factors of for the given <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>The first step improves the computation time over the naive approach drastically. <span class="math inline">\(O(\sqrt n)\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span>. The second, allows us to shorten the set of numbers from <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt n\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> we need to divide by.</p>

<h3>Proposed Algorithm</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>n = 50

factors = function(n){
  
  n_l = 2 : ceiling(sqrt(n)) # initialise range below sqrt n
  f_b = n_l[n %% n_l == 0] # retain factors
  
  if(!length(f_b)) return(c(1,n))  # if prime 

  f_a = c()
  
  for(i in 1: length(f_b)){
    
    upr = ceiling(sqrt(n) + 1):ceiling((n / f_b[i])) # initialise range above sqrt n
    f_a[i] =  upr[upr * f_b[i] == n]
    
  }
  return(sort(c(1,f_b,f_a)))
}

system.time(factors(1e8))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    user  system elapsed 
##    0.47    0.15    1.19</code></pre>
<p>We need to loop through each value of <code>f_b</code> , as this can’t (in any simple way) be done through a vectorised approach. I would be extremely interested to see a fully vectorised implementation. Do get in touch if you’re on to something.</p>

<h3>Naive Approach</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>dummy = function(n){
   
  f = 2
  
  for(i in 2:(n/f)){
    if(n %% i == 0) f = i  
   }
