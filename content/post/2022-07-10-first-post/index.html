<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>R is primarily a language created for and by statisticians. In this field it performs remarkably, and is an extremely powerful tool in solving mathematical complexities. A main feature of the language is its vectorisation capability, largely circumventing the need for explicit for-loops. Though efficient in lower level languages like C++, looping is generally ill-advised when programming in R, as there usually is a more elegant and efficient method to compute values iteratively / recursively.
This page describes how to solve double sums in R using different methods, while introducing an underused function of the language. It concludes by benchmarking these methods against each other.</p>
<div id="eq-1" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Eq 1</em></h3>
<p>Consider the following double sum:
<span class="math display" id="eq:loop1">\[\begin{equation}

\sum_{i=1}^{20}\sum_{j=1}^{5}\frac{i^4}{(3 + j)}

\tag{1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Although this looks like it might be a nightmare to solve, the process of solving a double sum is quite simple. We start off by evaluating the inner sum for values <span class="math inline">\(1\le j\le5\)</span> while the outer sums index is held constant at <span class="math inline">\(i=1\)</span>. We continue doing this for each <span class="math inline">\(1\le i\le20\)</span> iteratively. When all <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> sums have been calculated all that is left to do is to add all our values and find our answer!</p>
<p>For our first attempt let’s use a method that faithfully implements the logic of the procedure explained above:</p>
<div id="i-using-a-loop" class="section level5">
<h5>i) Using a loop</h5>
<p>We use nested loops to represent the inner and outer sums. <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is incremented by 1 after every run of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. We then compute the sum and get our result.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum = 0
for(i in 1:20){
  for(j in 1:5){
    sum = sum + i^4 / (3 + j)
  }
}
sum</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 639215.3</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="ii-using-simplification-of-double-sum" class="section level5">
<h5>ii) Using simplification of double sum</h5>
<p>For our second method we will use some basic algebric manipulation to simplify the computation. First,lets set <span class="math inline">\(i^4\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3+j}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Following the procedure described above for <span class="math inline">\(i=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\le j\le5\)</span> we get <span class="math inline">\(a_1b_1 + a_1b_2 + a_1b_3+ a_1b_4 + a_1b_5\)</span>, for succinctness we write this as <span class="math inline">\(a_1(b_1+b_2+b_3+b_4+b_5)\)</span>. Next we increment <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> by 1 and repeat the same procedure giving us <span class="math inline">\(a_2b_1 + a_2b_2 + ...+a_2b_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, we have <span class="math inline">\(a_1(b_1+b_2+b_3+b_4+b_5) + a_2(b_1+b_2+b_3+b_4+b_5) = (a_1 +a_2)(b_1+b_2 + b_3+b_4 +b_5)\)</span>. This could be written as <span class="math inline">\((a_1 +a_2 + ..+a_i)(b_1 +b_2+..b_j)\)</span> which using the summation notation is <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^{20} a_i \sum_{j=1}^{5} b_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus we have the representation: <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^{20}\sum_{j=1}^{5}\frac{i^4}{(3 + j)} = \sum_{i=1}^{20}i^4 \sum_{j=1}^{5}\frac{1}{(3 + j)}\]</span> The double sum is equal to the product of the sum of <span class="math inline">\(i^4\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(1\le i\le20\)</span> and the sum of <span class="math inline">\(3 +j\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(1\le j\le5\)</span> !</p>
<p>The following code in R implements this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum((1:20) ^ 4) * sum(1/(4:8))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 639215.3</code></pre>
<p>Great, its the same answer.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that <span class="math inline">\((3 + j)\)</span> has been simplified to 4:8 accounting for j’s indexing.</p>
</div>
<div id="iii-using-matrices" class="section level5">
<h5>iii) Using matrices</h5>
<p>Before describing the third method it would make sense to introduce the <code>outer</code> function provided in <code>base</code> r. The function takes three arguments and returns the matrix obtained by performing the specified operation between each value of x and y. <code>outer(1:2,1:2)</code> returns the <span class="math inline">\(2X2\)</span> matrix 2, 3, 3, 4:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>outer(1:2,1:2,&quot;+&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      [,1] [,2]
## [1,]    2    3
## [2,]    3    4</code></pre>
<p>Since the double sum in <em>eq 1.</em> requires calculating all combinations of the values <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and then computing the sum of <span class="math inline">\(f(i,j)\)</span>, the <code>outer</code> function makes sense to use:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(outer((1:20) ^ 4,4:8,&quot;/&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 639215.3</code></pre>
<p>We compute <span class="math inline">\(f(i,j)\)</span> through the outer function and then sum over all values in the returned matrix.</p>
<p>With this method we don’t have to perform any algebraic manipulation to define a solution, while also keeping true to R’s vectorised approach. Computers also tend to be very good at handling matrix arithmetic(??).</p>

<div id="eq-2" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Eq 2</em></h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^{20}\sum_{j=1}^{5}\frac{i^4}{3 + ij}\]</span></p>
<p>Equation 2. is slightly harder to solve as <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are grouped together in the same expression in the denominator. Note that we cannot split this expression as we have in (# eqn) since the value of the denominator now depends on the value of the outer loop. We can however isolate the ij and work out its double sum. In the solution that follows ,we calculate all values of <span class="math inline">\(i^4\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span> and divide by the matrix returned by solving <span class="math inline">\(3 + \sum_{i=1}^{20}\sum_{j=1}^{5}ij\)</span> (the denominator).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum((1:20) ^ 4/(3 + outer(1:20,1:5,&quot;*&quot;)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 89912.02</code></pre>
<p>The division works since the default behaviour of R while multiplying a vector by a matrix is done column-wise.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div id="eq-3" class="section level3">
<h3><em>Eq 3</em></h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^{10}\sum_{j=1}^{i}\frac{i^4}{3 + ij}\]</span>
The hardest rendering of the double sum. Here not only is the value of the denominator determined by the values of the inner and outer loops, but the upper limit of the indexing of the inner loop is also given by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Thus, while <span class="math inline">\(i = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3 + ij = 4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> has only one iteration. For <span class="math inline">\(i=2\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(3+ij = \sum_{j=1}^{2} (3 + ij) = 5 + 7 = 12\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> has two iterations and so on. Given that the functional form of the equation is much the same to (eq 2), we already have the tools to solve the double sum. We just have to figure out a way to only compute values for the expression within the double sum when <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is below or equal to <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(outer(1:10,1:10,function(i,j)(j &lt;= i) * i^4/(3 + i*j)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6944.743</code></pre>
<p>A clever use of a logical test that takes advantage of the fact that TRUE and FALSE are represented as <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> numerically.Notice how we can define the entire function within the function call to outer. We could not do this with the previous equations since the range of the indexing of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> differed.</p>

<div id="the-waiting-time-of-the-nth-customer-in-a-single-server-queue" class="section level2">
<h2><em>The waiting time of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span><sup>th</sup> customer in a single server queue</em></h2>
<p>Suppose customers labelled <span class="math inline">\(C_{0}, C_{1}, . . . ,Cn\)</span>
arrive at times <span class="math inline">\(τ = 0, τ_{1}, . . . , τ_{n}\)</span> for service by a single server. The inter arrival times <span class="math inline">\(A_{1} = τ_{1} − τ_{0}, . . . ,A_n = τ_n − τ_n\)</span> are independent and identically distributed random variables with the exponential density
<span class="math inline">\(λ_ae^{−λ_ax}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x \ge 0\)</span>.
The service times <span class="math inline">\(S_0, S_1, . . . , S_n\)</span> are independent and identically distributed random variables which are
also independent of the interarrival times with the exponential density
<span class="math inline">\(λ_se^{−λ_sx}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x ≥ 0\)</span>.
Let <span class="math inline">\(Wj\)</span> denote the waiting time of customer <span class="math inline">\(Cj\)</span> . Hence customer <span class="math inline">\(Cj\)</span> leaves at time <span class="math inline">\(τ_j + Wj + Sj\)</span> . If this
time is greater than <span class="math inline">\(τ_j+1\)</span> then the next customer, <span class="math inline">\(Cj+1\)</span> must wait for the time <span class="math inline">\(τ_j + Wj + Sj − τ_j+1\)</span>. Hence, we have the recurrent relation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(W0 = 0\)</span>
<span class="math inline">\(Wj+1 = max(0, Wj + Sj − Aj+1)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(j = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1\)</span></p>
<p>We are to write a function that simulates one outcome of <span class="math inline">\(Wn\)</span> where <em>aRate</em> denotes <span class="math inline">\(λ_a\)</span> and <em>sRate</em> denotes <span class="math inline">\(λ_s\)</span>.</p>
<p>The question that seems daunting at first, but is actually deceptively simple to solve. In fact, since the equation to solve for <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> has been given to us and both <span class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> are random variables drawn from a defined probability distribution, we just have to implement the recursion.</p>
<p>Understanding why <span class="math inline">\(C_{j+1}\)</span> has to wait for <span class="math inline">\(t_j + W_j + S_j -t_{j+1}\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(tj + wj + Sj &gt; t_j+1\)</span>, is absolutely not <em>necessary</em> for the solution. It is poor form however to not comprehend the question.If nothing else, it makes maths seem approachable.</p>
<p>The relation above implies that if customers one time to wait, be served and leave is greater than the time customer two arrived at then customers two’s waiting time is customer ones’ time of departure subtracted from customer two’s time of arrival. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is derived recursively - one customers time to get through an order is the next person waiting time and so on. Below is a function that does this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>queue = function(n,aRate,sRate){
  
  w = 0
  cnt = 0
  
  while(cnt &lt; n){
  
  a_n = aRate * rexp(1,aRate)
  s_n = sRate * rexp(1,sRate)
  w = max(0,w + s_n - a_n)
  
  cnt = cnt + 1
  }
  
  return(w)
  
         }</code></pre>
<p>The question and answer are both terribly simple, once understood!</p>
<p>The following problems are taken from a University of Warwick Math department graded exercise sheet, <a> </a>. The elegant solution to Eq. 3 is also sourced from the paper.</p>
